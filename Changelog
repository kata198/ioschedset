* 1.0.1 - Dec 06 2018

- Add a local PKGBUILD which will build a package directly from the git tree. This differs from the AUR version which downloads a source tarball and works from that.

- Expand the readme, split into sections, add installation notes for Arch Linux

- install.sh - Cleanup, add a bunch of comments. Actually check the return-code of the calls to 'install' and fail the install script if they fail. Cleanup and improve a lot of the output. Have install.sh overwrite the VERSION variable in io-get-sched and io-set-sched based on the one found within itself

* 1.0.0 - Dec 05 2018

- Initial Release
